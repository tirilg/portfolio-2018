        <p>In the theme of Basic Web I learned basic HTML and CSS to create a mobile website based on the art-style of naivism,
            as well as a responsive version with media queries. It was my first time ever coding, and creating something
            in illustrator, which was difficult but a lot of fun once I spent some time doing it.
            <br>
            <br>The final assignment for this theme was a group project where we redesigned a website, which is where I learned
            a lot about working professionally in a group, and got a better understanding for coding, especially grids.</p>

        <p>In this theme I learned more about the business aspect of multimedia design. The task I got together with my group
            was to create a fictional digital agency and digital service. We coded a prototype website for the agency and
            created an interactive prototype for the service in Illustrator and After Effects.
            <br><br>Through this task and the business model canvas, I learned about various aspects of what is needed to
            start your own business. In addition, I learned about the importance of groupwork in a professional environment
            in order to create value. One of the things my group and I struggeled with was the revenue stream, and how our
            digital agency would generate profit.</p>

            Basic Video<br><br><br>
        </h2>
        <p>I went into the theme of video with some basic knowledge of filming and editing, but it was still very educational
            having to come up with your own ideas and work in a group with others to optimize that idea.
            <br><br>For the first assignment we had to tell a story without using any words, which was interesting. I learned
            how you can easily create a stressed feeling for the viewer by simply using sounds and quick cuts in editing.
            The second assignment was to come up with a city walk for people to see Copenhagen, and show it in a video. We
            decided to do a dare, and it was fun but but also challenging to not film where we are not allowed and include
            footage where you can recognize strangers. We also wanted to work with After Effects, but it proved itself to
            be more difficult than we thought, which is why the screens in the video are black.

            <br><br>Both videos were filmed using Filmic Pro Mobile with iPhone 7 and DJI Osmo Mobile gimbal for better image
            stabilization.

            What did I learn?<br><br><br>
        </h2>

        <p>During my first semester at KEA I have touched upon many different aspects of multimedia design, where we mostly
            learned the basics of each area. However, once I was taught the basics, it was motivating and easy to learn more
            by myself. Once I got a better understanding of different programming languages and Adobe programmes, it opened
            up many possibilites of what I could do.

            <br><br>Most of all, I have gotten a lot more experience of what it is like to work professionally in groups
            to reach a common goal. This is very important knowledge seeing as a multimedia designer very often has to do
            this. It was not always easy to direct tasks and take control in a group setting, but it was still very important
            to get used to it early on.
            <br><br>I have not only learned a lot of new things, but also realized how much fun it can be to learn and work
            digitally.
